# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning 📉🧠

This project focuses on developing a churn prediction model using real-world customer transaction data from **Tesco**. The primary goal was to identify patterns and early indicators of customer churn to inform retention strategies.

> 🔒 Due to a Data Sharing Agreement (DSA), the dataset used in this project **cannot be shared publicly** as it contains real Tesco customer transaction data.

> 📘 A detailed explanation of the methodology and results is available in the [coursework_report.pdf](docs/coursework_report.pdf) included in this repository.

> 📘 A supporting document is available explaning how to run the model in the [supporting_documentation.pdf](docs/supporting_documentation.pdf) included in this repository.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Built a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn using anonymised retail data.
- Feature engineering was conducted directly within **PostgreSQL**, focusing on temporal patterns, transaction recency, frequency, and monetary value.
- Evaluated multiple classifiers including **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.
- XGBoost performed best with a 0.71 Balanced Accuracy score, a strong performance for real-world data.
